392. Is Subsequence

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 100
0 <= t.length <= 104
s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.
 

Follow up: Suppose there are lots of incoming s, say s1, s2, ..., sk where k >= 109, and you want to check one by one to see if t has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

"""
Time complexity: O(n) - n: length of string t
Space complexity: O(1) - the algorithm uses a fixed amount of space regardless of the input size

Steps:
    1. Create two pointers, i and j
    2. While i < len(s) and j < len(t):
    3. If at a certain point, s[i] == t[j], increment i ( string s)
    4. Increment j ( string t)
    5. Return True if i == len(s)
